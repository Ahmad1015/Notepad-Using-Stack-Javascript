# Notepad-with-Stack

This repository contains a simple notepad web app that has buttons to undo and redo the text using a stack data structure. It was created to practice the concept of stack and its applications.

## Technologies

The project was built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The markup language used for the structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS**: The style sheet language used for the appearance and design of the app.

## Features

The app has the following features:

- **Notepad**: A text area where the user can type, edit, and delete text.
- **Undo**: A button that allows the user to undo the last action performed on the text. It uses a stack to store the previous states of the text and pops the top element when the button is clicked.
